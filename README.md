# ICML2025-COBUILD-contest

This repository is intended to provide code necessary to replicate the results for the [ICML2025-COBUILD contest](https://sites.uw.edu/co-build/common-task-framework-challenge/). (Submission link provided later).

The code* files can be found in the 'src' folder. To replicate results, you can directly download the files or clone repository and run notebooks after installing requirements. The notebooks have in-built data download functionality. Note that some of the results might differ due to hyperparameter optimization. 

<sub>*The code has been modified and written with the help of Claude Sonnet 4. Idea initialization, conceptualization, methodology development, investigation, and writing have been done without assistance.</sub>
