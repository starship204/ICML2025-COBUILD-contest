# ICML2025-COBUILD-contest

This repository is intended to provide code necessary to replicate the results for the [ICML2025-COBUILD contest](https://sites.uw.edu/co-build/common-task-framework-challenge/). (Submission link provided later).

The code files can be found in the 'src' folder. To replicate results, you can directly download the files or clone repository and run notebooks after installing requirements. The notebooks have in-built data download 

<sub>*The code has been modified and written with the help of Claude Sonnet 4. Idea initialization, conceptualization, methodology development, investigation, and writing have been done without assistance.</sub>
